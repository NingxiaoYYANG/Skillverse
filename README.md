# Skillverse
The mission of Skillverse is to break down the barriers of centralized educational institutions and eliminate the monopoly of education certification by such institutions. It aims to provide equal access to high-quality educational resources and more scientifically recognized professional certifications for everyone.

# Background
The graduation certificates issued by centralized educational institutions today may not always fully reflect an individual's professional and vocational capabilities in the industry. Possessing a certificate issued by a certain educational institution does not necessarily represent a true mastery of a particular field's professional skills. Moreover, many prestigious educational institutions are only open to a small portion of the world's population. The vast majority of people, especially those living in underprivileged areas, can never access the learning resources of these authoritative educational institutions, let alone obtain their certificates. Skillverse is committed to addressing this series of problems, breaking down the barriers of centralized educational institutions, and enabling people from around the world to enjoy educational resources and receive genuine professional competency certification that aligns with their respective fields.

# Government
In addition to the participation of team members in the development of the project, Skillverse will also adopt a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance model. We welcome everyone in the Web3 world to have the opportunity to participate in the project's development. By leveraging the industry advantages of Web3, we aim to achieve true fairness and genuine decentralization.

# Tokenomics
The total token supply is 100 million tokens. 65% of the tokens will be distributed in batches to different categories of participants to support ecosystem development. 20% of the tokens will be allocated for financing and given to investors. 15% of the tokens will be reserved for team incentives.

# How do I participate in Skillverse?
Learners will have the opportunity to continuously earn airdropped tokens as rewards during their learning journey. Additionally, when reaching certain levels of proficiency, they will be eligible to receive corresponding NFT rewards, which will serve as certifications in their respective fields. We also welcome experts in various fields to share their knowledge on the platform. In addition to receiving airdropped token rewards, they can earn additional incentives by offering paid content, which learners can access by using project tokens for payment.

# How can I benefit from Skillverse?
The platform will charge a certain percentage of service fees with each successful payment. These service fees will be regularly burned, creating dividends for users holding the project tokens.
